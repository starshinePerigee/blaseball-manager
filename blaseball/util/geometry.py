"""
We were using sympy for geometry handling, but there were too many quirks - so we're switching to Shapely.
Luckily, we were already wrapping Sympy, so shapely just has to drop in here.

It probably would make more sense to use shapely objects directly, or inherit directly, but
we can deal with that later.
