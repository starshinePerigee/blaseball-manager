This supercedes game_plan.txt.

All players have a location. Bases and the ball also have locations.

0. Locate ball position on ground.
1. determine closest fielder.
2. roll for catch
2a. if catch, mark runner out, all others have to tag up
2b. if no catch, add error time based on miss.
3. you now have the "safe time" - for each runner, calculate their position on the basepaths
4. each runner decides how much to go based on position, situation, speed, etc.
5. fielder looks at positions and decides who to throw to
6. make throw, roll for error
7. on error, add error time and return to 4,

4 can use the same logic as stealing?





second pass:

1. roll for catch
2. if catch, mark runner out, mark all other runners tagging up
3. fielder decides where to throw
4. roll for throw time
5. advance all runners by throw time
6. check if player is out
7. go to 3

if not catch:
2. get safe time
3. advance all runners by safe time
4. iterate through runners to decide
5. fielder decides where to throw
6. roll for throw time
7. advance all runners by throw time
8. check if player is out
9. go to 4
