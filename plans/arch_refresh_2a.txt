Let's get even more decoupled!

1. statsmonitor sucks really bad
2. pitchmonitor is kind of weird - we can do this with just messenger?

so basically, all the different pieces get initialized by ballgame, communicate over messenger naturally

how many bits do we have?

PitchListener
SwingListener
HitListener
BasepathsManager
FieldingListener


Question - these all need to access (and sometimes modify) game state.

Options:
1. A StateListener class, which each manager has a copy of, that subscribes to gamestate messengers
2. Provide a link to The Gamestate for each manager.

1:
+ provides cleaner interface
+ controls effects on gamestate

2:
+ performance
+ we're already doing 'globals' with


answer:
- use pointer to single state, with a messenger for when that state updates
