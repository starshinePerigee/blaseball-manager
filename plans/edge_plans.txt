EDGE has four components, which all affect the game through out of game stuff:

- Heckling: How good a player is at getting under another player's skin; this can work from the dugout, but
this is most effective when there is a relationship between a player and victim, and there are
bonuses to proximity when players are at bat or on base.
- Strategy: a player's understanding of the game and knowledge of the other team, which is passed to players
on their team but especially when they're mentors or coaches
- Leadership: how much of a boost a player can provide to another player from the dugout by providing words
of advice or inspiration; works best in close, critical situations.
- I.T.: a player's ability to operate office equipment.


when a player is not on the field in blaseball, there's a ton of things they can be doing:
- basecoach (1st and 3rd)
- mentor
- dugout
- captain


I.T.:
during-game decisions, such as substitutions and special calls, are made via office equipment:
- fax machine, toaster oven, voicemail, etc.

each machine has an "tech cost" that you pay for by assigning non-active players to the "helpdesk"
if the tech cost is too low, they have a (high) chance of breaking and not triggering.


Basecoach:
you can assign two players as basecoaches. this gives them the following effects:
- proximity for strategy, mentor, and heckle


STRATEGY
every player has a decision rating.
this is used to set narrowness of "decision fuzzing"

This is the maximum of the following:
the player's own strategy
their respective basecoach's or catcher's strategy (minus a small penalty)
their mentor's strategy, if the mentor is not active (minus a medium penalty)
the highest strategy for a non-active player (minus a large penalty)
this is highly affected by relationships

having two factors (ie: basecoach + mentor) cancel out penalties and can even result in a higher strategy
than that player's own.
