stats refactor

doc refactor

refactor to use stats handlers in classes
add additional fielding descriptions
fix pitch descriptors (mph and type)
write hit descriptors
add/fix spacers and stat dumps
fix docs / remove old plans
write balance tests
review converting some module methods to staticmethods?

pull single module run code

create git tag

to consider:
- which classes persist vs. which are destroy and remake / which are passed around?
- basepaths is being managed in two places and that sucks
- convert stats list from strings to enum or pull from class directly?


refactor private methods/members into private
