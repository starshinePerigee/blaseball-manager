finish ballgame tests

refactor to use Logging (loguru?) + error handling
- error handling on messenger sends as the firewall

write stats handlers
refactor to use stats handlers in classes
fix docs
write balance tests


to consider:
- which classes persist vs. which are destroy and remake / which are passed around?
- basepaths is being managed in two places and that sucks
- convert stats list from strings to enum or pull from class directly?
