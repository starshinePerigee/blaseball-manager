move messenger sends into subclasses
decouple bases and pitchmanager?
- pitchmanager and fielding are independent modules connected by messenger?

finish adding tracking stats
convert all blaseball to use s.stats
add expected min/max/average to stats
coarse balance pass

revise some stats?

settle on an import style
remove Typing dependency


add additional fielding descriptions
fix pitch descriptors (mph and type)
write hit descriptors
add/fix spacers and stat dumps
write balance tests
review converting some module methods to staticmethods?

pull single module run code

create git tag

to consider:
- which classes persist vs. which are destroy and remake / which are passed around?
- basepaths is being managed in two places and that sucks
- convert stats list from strings to enum or pull from class directly?
