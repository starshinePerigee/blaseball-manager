What actions are there?
- pitch
- throw out stealing
- steal attempt
- dumb bs

an event is anything that happens that can do something :c

ok specifically:
an event is:
- something
- becuase of a player, other event, or external factor
- that affects the game state
- and updates the display
- have text
- during a game


ok you need to avoid events chains AT ALL COSTS this is WAY TOO COMPLICATED

go see game_plan.txt for new fielding.

Anyway, this doesn't change a lot about how events work.

Event:
- designed to be inherited from
- base methods:
-- update_game(game)
-- feed_text() -> str
- contains a list of Updates

an Update:
- a single moment
- with a corresponding graphic, game state update, or text line


So the call chain is:

1. BallGame handles actions until it's pitch time
2. BallGame creates a PitchHit(Event)
3. Pitchhit steps through the hitting process, building a chain of Updates
3a. Pitchhit calls Fielding if necessary, gets more events through the fielding engine
3b. Fielding updates game as it goes
3c. Pitchhit returns the list of Updates to the game.
4. Game calls updategame, if there is a LiveBall returned, it creates a fielding event
5. Fielding event is also passed into the events cruncher
