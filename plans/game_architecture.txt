                Events


What actions are there?
- pitch
- throw out stealing
- steal attempt
- dumb bs

an event is anything that happens that can do something :c

ok specifically:
an event is:
- something
- becuase of a player, other event, or external factor
- that affects the game state
- and updates the display
- have text
- during a game


ok you need to avoid events chains AT ALL COSTS this is WAY TOO COMPLICATED

go see game_plan.txt for new fielding.

Anyway, this doesn't change a lot about how events work.

Event:
- designed to be inherited from
- base methods:
-- update_game(game)
-- feed_text() -> str

Hit + fielding are two separate events? so we need a structure that passes between them.
This is a LiveBall.
- this also lets us generate fielding events at any position, including from other fielding events.

So the call chain is:

1. BallGame handles actions until it's pitch time
2. BallGame creates a PitchHit(Event)
3. Pitchhit steps through the hitting process, generates a LiveBall if needed
4. Game calls updategame, if there is a LiveBall returned, it creates a fielding event
5. Fielding event is also passed into the events cruncher
