                    Throw
                    Live-ball

What actions are there?
- pitch
- throw out stealing
- steal attempt
- dumb bs

an event is anything that happens that can do something :c

ok specifically:
an event is:
- something
- becuase of a player, other event, or external factor
- that affects the game state
- and updates the display
- and may have test
- during a game

between each event we have an open step?

at bat
    actions
        event
            upkeep
        event
            upkeep
            event
            event

so this is looking like we need an events chain?

between each event is an upkeep?

user story:

- there are players on 1b and 3b, each with a leadoff
- the ball is pitched
- players start running
- it's a hit to left field
- LF gets the ball and throws to H
- 3b runner dives
- 1b makes it to 2b, decides to go for it
- ball reaches 2b, throws to 3b
- it's a rundown
- 2b makes an error, ball goes wide
- runner decides to run for home
- thrown out lol

is there any way to avoid an effects chain system with time steps and tracking? because that would be overkill.
1: assume the only thing that could make players make a decision is the motion of the ball
- position of other players? ie: go / nogo for running
- can you look backwards? ie: "would this player have gone or non-gone" and then just do:
- - event (ball motion)
- - upkeep (all players have a chance to do a thing)
- - event
- - upkeep
