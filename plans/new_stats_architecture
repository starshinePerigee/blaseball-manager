There are a handful of issues that are currettly emerging with the way stats are handled at the moment:

- a ton of stats are "derived stats":
    > attributes w/ modifier effects
    > some way of getting base stats
    > derived performance stats (batting averages, etc)


- updating a running average every time will slowly cause drift from error accumulation
    > is this even a concern on our scale/precision?

- stats.py is a horrible mess

- indexing by "string" is kind of annoying, and could be improved
    > class member lookup?
    > enum?

- statshortener is kinda silly
    > abbreviations should be stored in the class database

- a stat should be an object all the time (instead of just some of the time?

- player indexing in general could be tuned? (index via stats class + player CID instead of player index?)

- auto-track if derived columns are "stale" and recompute only when necessary (end of game?)

- why is AllStats a singleton class when it could be a module?


oh god this is going to be horrid, isn't it.


here's the plan:

all stats are a Stats class instance in the top level module of stats

stats is designed to be imported as "import stats as s"

player indexing indexes off Stats primarily - passes a CID and Playerbase reference to stats

some stats are derived - they have dependent stats. If the dependent stats are modified, these stat categories become
stale, and must be recalculated every time. Otherwise, you can use the cached version.

Stats are stale per-player - they're their own columns


stale flags are player attributes instead of df columns? (faster)


What is up with weights / descriptors / categories??
    - weight:
        did not used to be stats. used to be their own thing, which was maintained by all_stats.
        weights was pulled by descriptors.py and used to generate a descriptor
    - descriptor:
        a string that describes an aspect of a player. Weight --descriptors.py+playerdescriptors.py--> descriptors
    - category:
        a top level stat that summarizes a player's ability in an aspect of blaseball.
        "isn't that just weight" you might ask?
        well, yes - but it's processed somewhere else (right now) and displayed as a numeric.
        also, stats fall under a category.
