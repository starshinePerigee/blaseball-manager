Players are defined by a fairly complicated series of attributes. A handful are up-front to managers,
to help them understand and make decisions for players, but most are buried for true statheads
and game developers.

Note: RATINGS are what define a player. STATISTICS are the measured performance of that player.


1. Rating Overview:

The most import and and fundamental rating governing a player are the "Personality Ratings".
These represent who a character is "at the core".

They are rolled and modified sharply by a set of traits that describe who a character is (ref CK3)
Traits can be pure good, pure bad, or balanced.

These are known as the "Big Four", and are (currently) as follows:

Determination
Enthusiasm
Stability
Insight

These are difficult to change directly, but can change over time as traits are added / removed.

A manager should be able to look at the big four and tell what kind of role a player would play
on the team - on and off the field.

The Big Four are used to determine the functional ratings. These are split into three groups:

- condition
- social
- baseball

Each category represents a wide array of "deep ratings", which are initially obscured from the manager.
These are grouped into the "derived ratings" (the DR), which are straightforward representations of how
good a player is in each category:
B4 x D6 = performance characteristics = deep ratings

The deep ratings are them summarized in rating descriptors, which are attached to the D6 to give a
quick english representation of how a player plays in each type.

Lastly, condition deep ratings don't round up to derived ratings, but to the actual condition ratings -
three ratings that change frequently day-to-day that represent a player's current readiness to
engage in blaseball.


2. The Personality Ratings

There are four personality ratings, which each affect a wide swath of that player's activity, both
on and off the field. Reading the personality ratings gives a good idea what kind of hitter, runner,
fielder, pitcher, and friend the player would be - assuming their base stars in that category are
sufficient.

- Determination: determination leads to power and willpower. Determined players hit hard and throw
fast. They're a "three true outcome" player - both as a hitter and a pitcher. Determination doesn't
help a ton with baserunning or fielding. Off the field, determined players are cool and respected,
and make good leaders and stars.

- Enthusiasm: enthusiasm affects a player's movement and excitement. Enthusiastic players like to hit
and run, and make great contact players who are fast on the basepaths and in the outfield. A very
high-enthusiasm player is also fun off the field, whether they're on the bench or in a scrimmage;
their jokes and taunts help their friends and distract their opponents.

- Stability is a player's centeredness and control. A high stability player makes few errors
and is hard to shake - their throws (both fielding and pitching) are accurate and precise, and they
fill most roles in defense. Stable players support themselves and their teammates off field and
make solid friends in tough times.

- Insight is the key to special techniques of blaseball, from regular tricky pitches and bunts,
all the way up to special abilities unique to that player. Insight lets players understand when to
steal, and how to stop it. Perhaps most importantly, insight is required for a player to effectively
coach another player and let them reach their full potential.


3. Vibes

Vibes represent several factors that tie into a player's day-to-day effectiveness on and off the field.
This overall effectiveness is represented by a single rating: Vibes

- Vibes: A player's overall effectiveness at the current moment.

Vibes are determined by multiplying three dependent ratings together:

- Stamina: physical ability, used up by play and strenuous practice. Harder, more physical work drains
           more stamina, and playing a full blaseball game is extremely draining. Stamina trends towards
           100% over time, but recovery helps it reach 100% faster and can even get it above 100% for
           temporary boosts.

- Mood: mental outlook, affected by teammates and memories. Making a player do things they don't want to
         affects mood, but so does a player's memories and relationships. Mood doesn't have a fixed
         setpoint the same way Stamina does, but instead follows relationships and memory -
         a happy and well supported player can stay at 150% mood and get the condition bonuses that
         come with it

- Soul: the player's overall presence and "age"
                Corporeality starts high, and trends ierreversably lower over play and time.

Soul doesn't directly affect condition; instead as it falls:
1. first, they have a harder time gaining ratings
2. past a certain threshold, stamina degrades faster with use
3. past a final threshold, the overall condition is permanently affected.

There is little you can do to prevent Soul from falling, but stamina and mood are both affected
by a player's vitality ratings - deep ratings set in part by a player's personality.

- Endurance: affects how much a player loses stamina from physical activity
- Positivity: how much a player loses vibes from negative memories and actions
- Energy: affects how much a player loses vibes from social activity, including social training
          such as scrimmages
- Recovery: affects how much a player recovers stamina and (somewhat) vibes with rest

Lastly, injuries and other happenstance will affect stamina, vibes, and often directly impact condition
as well.


4. Social Ratings

The primary modifiers for a player's relationships, happiness, and actions are contained in
THE GRID and THE MEMORY LINE; but the social ratings help shape how a player reacts (and will
especially determine how vibes are spent in routine training).

There are four social ratings:

- Teaching: how good they are at conveying information when coaching or training
- Cool: how much a player stands out to other players and fans, how good they are at intimidation
- Hangouts: how good a player is when hanging out during non-work sections, such as benchwarming and parties
- Support: how good a player is at providing support to players, helping them deal with stress and bad memories

A player's top 1 or 2 social ratings combine to create their Element, which goes into the type compatibility
chart to determine who they would get along with.


5. Blaseball Ratings

Blaseball ratings are the most straightforward - how does a player actually play the game?
Four of the derived blaseball ratings should be familiar to anyone who plays blaseball:

- Batting
- Baserunning
- Fielding
- Pitching
- Edge

"Edge" represents additional bonuses a player can contribute while not on the field: heckling and cheeriing

Deep blaseball ratings are used by the baseball engine to actually roll for player performance,
and can be viewed through a deeper screen, possibly after being unlocked by the manager.

Batting:
- Power: How likely a good hit is to travel far, how good a player is at hitting HRs
- Contact: How good a player is at hitting difficult pitches
- Discipline: A player's ability to read pitches - to let balls be balls and swing at strikes,
              as well as their ability to decide if special hits are required.
- Pull: a player's average launch angle when hitting; set at random but averages middle-left field

Baserunning:
- Speed: A player's base speed, helps in all baserunning attempts, but is a larger advantage when running
         multiple bases and when getting to first.
- Bravery: A player's willingness to take a large leadoff, dive, rundown, and their willingness to steal.
           If a player has bad enough timing, bravery is a downside.
- Timing: A player's decision-making while on the bases. Prevents being thrown out and lets read
          plays like fly outs better, allowing them to take extra bases.

Defense:
- Reach: The amount of ground a player can cover, and how good they are at catching fly outs.
         Required for outfielders
- Grabbiness: A player's catching ability, helping with ground outs, double plays, and avoiding errors.
              Required for infielders
- Throwing: A player's ability to throw the ball to a fellow defender quickly, accurately, and with few errors.
- Awareness: A pitcher or catcher's awareness of the field, helping them defend against steals.
- Calling: The player's ability to call for pitches, pickoffs, and set pitch targets as catcher (or pitcher).
a low calling will cause pitchers to give up more walks and first-pitch hits, while a high calling will even
improve the difficulty of a pitcher's pitches.

Pitching:
- Force: A pitcher's speed, represents how difficult the pitch is to hit.
- Accuracy: A pitcher's ability to throw the pitch at their target, dictating the ball and strike rate.
- Trickery: How much a pitch moves, which makes it harder to read and reduces power if the pitch is hit.

Edge:
- Heckling: How good a player is at getting under another player's skin; this can work from the dugout, but
this is most effective when there is a relationship between a player and victim, and there are
bonuses to proximity when players are at bat or on base.
- Sparkle: a player's ability to unlock and use powerful special abilities.
- Leadership: how much of a boost a player can provide to another player from the dugout by providing words
of advice or inspiration; works best in close, critical situations.
- I.T.: a player's ability to operate office equipment.

6. Rating Descriptors

This is a *TON* of ratings. However, most of these shouldn't be exposed to the average manager, so
summary ratings and "rating descriptors" are used.

For each of the following, an average of their total stars is created and displayed, as well as a
two or three word descriptor that identifies their strong points and suggested role. This will
also help identify how the AI treats these players:

Personality
Offense
Defense
Off Field

The following ratings are presented slightly removed, and are also summaries with a one-word descriptor:
Batting
Baserunning
Fielding
Pitching
Edge
Constitution
Social


7. Overall Goals and Player Experience

Ratings serve three purposes:
1. To make players different, to create interesting strategic decisions
2. To allow players to develop and grow in meaningful and distinct ways
3. To help shape how game logic functions

To enable these, managers need to be able to tell at a glance, in order:
1. how good is this player
2. what issues do they currently have
3. what role do they fill
4. will they work for my team
5. what place are they in their career
6. what strengths and weaknesses do they have
7. what should be developed in this player


8. Training

XYZZY

Players will have opportunities to develop their skills over time. This will be based on what skills they use,
but also who their coaches, friends, and memories guide them as. This lets specific deep ratings be worked on

However, training against personality can be more difficult; so personality will always be an effective guide
on both how to develop a player and what their capabilities are.

Effectively, "weaker" and "less necessary" top level ratings (baserunning especially) are trained naturally,
and come with side rewards for focusing on them. Developing a three true outcome hitter or ace fastball pitcher
means neglecting other stats, while building an all-rounder has an advantage to make up for the lack of focus.

heckling + cheering (enthusiasm)
leadership + compliments (determination)


11. How are ratings actually generated?

- a player's base personality is rolled, 0-1 down the middle
- traits are rolled and attached, affecting the player's personality for the deep ratings
-- these can push a player above 1 (5 stars)
- deep ratings are rolled, max(0, 1-personality) to min(personality, 0.5)
- derived ratings are derived and applied
- identifiers are applied

modify methods include derived stat updates

All ratings are 0-20, where each "1" is worth half a star
