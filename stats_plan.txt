Here are the stats from players.py:

ok, NEW FINAL PASS

players have four groups:

personality stats are "who the player is at the core"
traits (permanent and temporary) summed = stats
traits can be pure good, pure bad, or balanced (think ck3 but more variety)
goes into the "Big Five"
- determination
- excitement
- cleverness
- positivity

- toughness
- strength
- speed
-

- energy (resource?)

- introversion/extraversion

- humor
- sparkle

- element

(base element off of the big five?)
(single relationship stat + single blaseball outlook predictor)


condition stats change quickly, and represent mood, endurance, overall arc
- fatigue
- vibes
- injuries


relationship stats dictate overall mood, compatibility, and the RELATIONSHIP CHART shows who is good with who
use the Big Five, plus relationship links on the chart


blaseball stats represent specific ways a player can play blaseball
they are based on other stats, training, coaching, etc.

top level summary stats (stars + descriptor) and then underneath the gory details







all of these are a combination of constant numbers + discrete options,
with a strong bias for discrete options on the personality stats and lots of numbers for the blaseball stats







working backwards for the big five:

hitting has the following stats:
- power
- pitch reading
- contact vs fastballs
- contact vs curves
- contact vs changeups
- plate discipline
- hit accuracy
- ground vs fly
- hit control
- special skills (bunts, choking up)
- clutch

(OOTP has contact, HR power, gap power, eye (discipline), avoid Ks, sac bunt, bunt for hit)
(Blaseball has HR power (divinity), bunting (martyrdom), Discipline (moxie),
1 -> 2 conversion (musclitude), contact (path), gap power (thwack))

pitch reading (B / K, fly vs ground, decide ideal)
contact (decide if hit is possible)
power (decide power for swinging for power)
hit accuracy (gap accuracy, ground / fly accuracy)
bunt accuracy/success




running has the following stats:
- speed
- leadoff
- reaction time
- jukes (rundown ability)
- steal success
- steal willingness
- strategy / errors

(OOTP has running speed, stealing bases, baserunning instincts (taking advantage of misplays, etc.))
(Blaseball has steal chance (basethirst), overall speed (lazer), advancement on hits (continuation),
1 -> 3 odds (ground friction), advancement on outs (indulgence))

running speed (helps with defense too?)
bravery (diving, leadoff, steal willingness - bonus bases)
rundown ability (jukes)
strategy (steal timing, base running)




fielding has the following stats:
- speed (fly out interception)
- reaction
- ground fielding
- catching
- error rate
- strategy

(OOTP has range (speed), error, and arm (strength) for each infield, outfield, and catcher,
 plus turn double play and catcher ability)
(Blaseball has steal prevention (anticap), avoid extra base hits (chasiness), catching (omni),
some other unknown junk)


- range (possible overlap with speed)
- reaction (ground reactions, anti-steal, doubles)
- strength (pitch length, speed)
- accuracy (overlap with pitching accuracy?)
- error rate



pitching has the following:
- speed (fastball speed)
- technique (curve curve)
- trickiness (changeup effect)
- defense
- steal awareness
- accuracy (B vs K)
- strategy

(OOTP has Stuff (goodness), Movement (reduce hit power), and Control (BB vs K),
and then fastball, slider, changeup, splitter, and forkball)
(Blaseball has reduce power (overpowerment), K chance (unthwack), double play chance (shakesp), other stuff)

each pitch has:
- accuracy (does it go where you want)
- movement (how hard is it to hit well)
- speed (how hard is it to hit)
each type of pitch has a combination of the above

plus
steal awareness, and fielding



SO in total:

--HITTING--
pitch reading (B / K, fly vs ground, decide ideal)
contact (decide if hit is possible)
power (decide power for swinging for power)
hit accuracy (gap accuracy, ground / fly accuracy)
bunt accuracy/success
--RUNNING--
running speed (helps with defense too?)
bravery (diving, leadoff, steal willingness - bonus bases)
rundown ability (jukes)
strategy (steal timing, base running)
--FIELDING--
range (possible overlap with speed)
reaction (ground reactions, anti-steal, doubles)
strength (pitch length, speed)
accuracy (overlap with pitching accuracy?)
error rate
--PITCHING--
accuracy (does it go where you want)
movement (how hard is it to hit well)
speed (how hard is it to hit)
awareness (anti-stealing)
pitches




Boiling this down to be:
- simple
- clear
- readable

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

you have a STRONG player:
- put them as a clean-up hitter
- put them on third, and left outfield
- put them as a pitcher to shutdown weak hitters and other sluggers

you have a FAST player:
- put them at the top of the lineup
- put them on second, mid outfield
- put them in against a fast team

you have a TECHNIQUE player:
- put them second for contact to get batted in
- catcher, first base - lots of receiving but block errors
- put them as a pitcher for high-defense teams


~~~~~~


BATTING STRATEGY:

for hitting:
batting stars is overall "goodness" - contact + power

















~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~





BATTERS:
power is slugging and steal attempts  (divinity + basethirst)
tech is contact (thwack)
speed is running and steal success  (laserlikeness)

strat is plate discipline,
sparkle is special plays
(continuation + ground friction + indulgence)





power is a slugger who if they don't dinger, sits down
tech is a player who hits every time but can't get home
speed is a player who if they get on base they're amazing
strat is a player who can get walked a lot but otherwise no bueno

a "contact" player is tech / strat
a "power" player is power

1 tech / speed
2 strat / speed
3 tech / power
4 power
5 power / strat
6 strat / speed
7 w/e
8 w/e
9 tech / speed

RUNNERS:
(extension of batting, basically)
- SPEED
- power to STEAL (eg: power is a disadvantage on base)
- strat to NOT STEAL, correct leadoff


FIELDERS:
- power is throw speed, distance
- speed is "width" and getting fly and ground outs (when close)
- technique is receiving and avoiding errors
- strat is choosing the right target in a double play situation

catcher: STRAT / tech
1st: TECH
2nd: speed / tech
3rd: power / tech
SS: speed / power
RF: speed / strat
CF: speed / power / strat
LF: power / speed / strat


PITCHERS:
power increases your fastball (chance to hit) (unthack)
speed is for defensive stats and throwing out steals (coldness/shakespearianism)
technique is for pitching where needed (avoiding unnecessary balls, ruth)
strategy is for specialty pitches, which reduce impact (overpowerment)

(pitch CALLING is catcher strategy)














OK, so we have two options:
core stats lead blaseball stat development
or core stats ARE blaseball stats

in a way, this is about if we want to be a game or a management sim?

ideally, we focus more on out of game management. A single star pitcher needs 5 games to play once, and
baseball is very high variance - so we want to get a lot of games underway. (Especially if end of season
work is the ideal time to trade players, etc.)





What you actually want in a game:
- venue for weird effects
- highlights (for memory system)
- strategy testing


putting together "ideal" baseball positions should be as straightforward as possible.

HITTING: ***** contact
