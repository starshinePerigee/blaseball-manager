~~~~~~~~~~~

you have a STRONG player:
- put them as a clean-up hitter
- put them on third, and left outfield
- put them as a pitcher to shutdown weak hitters and other sluggers

you have a FAST player:
- put them at the top of the lineup
- put them on second, mid outfield
- put them in against a fast team

you have a TECHNIQUE player:
- put them second for contact to get batted in
- catcher, first base - lots of receiving but block errors
-

you have a STRATEGY player:
- first up
- late in rotation to enable handling weird situations
- catcher, for pitching bonuses

BATTERS:
power is slugging and steal attempts  (divinity + basethirst)
tech is contact (thwack)
speed is running and steal success  (laserlikeness)
strat is plate discipline, leadoff avoiding outs, special plays (all around low-level good bonuses ig)
(continuation + ground friction + indulgence)

power is a slugger who if they don't dinger, sits down
tech is a player who hits every time but can't get home
speed is a player who if they get on base they're amazing
strat is a player who can get walked a lot but otherwise no bueno

a "contact" player is tech / strat
a "power" player is power

1 tech / speed
2 strat / speed
3 tech / power
4 power
5 power / strat
6 strat / speed
7 w/e
8 w/e
9 tech / speed

RUNNERS:
(extension of batting, basically)
- SPEED
- power to STEAL (eg: power is a disadvantage on base)
- strat to NOT STEAL, correct leadoff


FIELDERS:
- power is throw speed, distance
- speed is "width" and getting fly and ground outs (when close)
- technique is receiving and avoiding errors
- strat is choosing the right target in a double play situation

catcher: STRAT / tech
1st: TECH
2nd: speed / tech
3rd: power / tech
SS: speed / power
RF: speed / strat
CF: speed / power / strat
LF: power / speed / strat


PITCHERS:
power increases your fastball (chance to hit) (unthack)
speed is for defensive stats and throwing out steals (coldness/shakespearianism)
technique is for pitching where needed (avoiding unnecessary balls, ruth)
strategy is for specialty pitches, which reduce impact (overpowerment)

(pitch CALLING is catcher strategy)
